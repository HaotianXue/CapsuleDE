#### Things have been done:
#### 1. The best classical model except XGB is SVM whose f1_score is about 60. However, it is too time-consuming(4h to train). Compared with other models, I think the most efficient model is Naive Bayes so far.
#### 2. Alothong ML models can do good job, but it seems that DL models outperform most ML models in most cases. I will make attempts to see if they can do better job.
#### 3. It seems like ml models(only with tfidf feature) can only gain f1_score like 50~60 except XGBoost.
#### 4. XGBoost shows unlimited potential in this task, it is still being trained and getting better and better results.According to the results of XGB so far, XGB even outperforms some of DL models. Good job XGB.
#### Things to do next:
#### 1. What about a voting system with XGB and SVM? That is interesting.
#### 2. Time to look into BERT I think.
